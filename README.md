# TELEGRAM_CMD_SCRIPT_FOR_AI_BOTS
An extensive command script for your telegram AI bot

5 main features of this script are as follows

1. set a disclaimer/tos cmd
2. have a response to your bots name
3. tell users to wait whilst running processes
4. blacklist and unblacklist users via chat id
5. have a report sent to your chat id of someone using your bot irresponsibly

this is an extensive cmd script for your user and group bots, check it out and if you do use it dont be a skid and claim it as yours and also remember to change the cmds, disclaimer and responses to your own ones.

thank you

ps i will also be releasing my ai bot script at some point in the future
